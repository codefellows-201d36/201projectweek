# Group Agreement
## What will your group do when it encounters conflict?
When we encounter conflict our group’s plan is to initially calm things down and have a group discussion about why exactly we aren’t seeing eye to eye. At this point instead of just simply having a vote to decide it usually makes sense to break things down logically and come to an agreement on the best course of action.
## How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?
A lot of these problems can be prevented in the initial stages by making sure work is adequately assigned to the various members and the individual members being vocal about feeling comfortable with the work they are assigned. Additionally, pair programming should help prevent this problem from occurring by ensuring there is always someone with you to help break down problem and assist with any issues. However, if the group feels someone is still not contributing at a high level the group shouldn’t be afraid to let the person know and brainstorm solutions together, but in a non-threatening and non passive-aggressive way. The “why” behind the lack of contributions should be addressed, and everyone should work to prevent placing blame. 
## How and when will you escalate the conflict if your attempts are unsuccessful? 
If our attempts to resolve conflicts are foiled  and we have relaxed to the point where we can discuss issues logically, the next step should be to get an outside opinion; someone who has a fresh opinion and hasn’t been involved directly the whole way. However, when outside council is requested we should strive to keep talk about our fighting to a minimum, the advice should just revolved around which solution makes more sense.
## How will you communicate after hours and on the weekend?
We will default to Slack and we have each other’s phone numbers if necessary.
## What is your strategy for ensuring everyone's voices are heard?
None of us seem to have an issue with speaking up now, and we are all open to anyone putting their 2 cents in at any point in our discussions.
## How will you ensure that you are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up?
Focus on the ideas and not the person. Consider what everyone has to say and stick to constructive criticism rather than toxicity. Keep politics out of the group.
